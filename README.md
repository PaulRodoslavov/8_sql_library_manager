# SQL Library Manager

## Overview of the Provided Project

I've created an application, local library to help manage collection of books. The user uses a simple SQLite database and enters data in manually.

In this project, I've built a web application included pages to list, add, update, and delete books.  I  implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
